## TL;DR

We are officially ClassClarus because clarus means clear in Latin and students who were surveyed said that the dashboard made things clearer for them. Also, it rolls off the tongue nicely, IMO: both class and clarus start with CL and end in S.

## What This means

This means we have finally have our own domain name! And it is <a href={"https://www.classclarus.com"}>classclarus.com</a>!

## Why ClassClarus

The name for this site needed to satisfy a few requirements:

1. It needed to begin with 'Class'.
2. The word after class needed to be only 1 or 2 syllables.

### The Meaning

According to <a href="https://latin-dictionary.net/definition/10281/clarus-clara">Latdict</a>, clarus means, among other things, clear, bright, gleaming. I thought that was fitting because maybe ClassClarus will make your class become more bright and clear as your student use it. 

After all, in an alpha survey filled out by students who used the site, the most liked feature was the student dashboard because it had their task list, which they said made it easy to see what they needed to work on.

## Where do we go from here?

Well, we will need to pick our brand colors. Can you tell we have none yet because of the black/white theme? ðŸ˜† Additionally, we need to get a logo designed that fits those colors and our brand identity. If you know anyone up to the challenge, have them email me at michael dot fitzgerald dot 1406 at gmail.com.
